## Description

The UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) is a hardware IP block that provides serial communication between devices. It is widely used for communication between microcontrollers, sensors, and other embedded systems.

## Key Features

- **Asynchronous Communication:** UART supports asynchronous serial communication, allowing devices with different clock frequencies to communicate.

- **Start and Stop Bits:** UART uses start and stop bits to frame each data byte, ensuring reliable data transmission.

- **Baud Rate Configurability:** UART allows users to configure the baud rate for communication based on their requirements.

- **Parity Bit Support:** UART supports optional parity bit generation and checking for error detection.

- **Full Duplex:** UART enables simultaneous transmission and reception of data, providing full-duplex communication.

## Usage

To use the UART IP block in your design, follow these steps:

1. Integrate the UART IP block into your RTL design.
2. Connect the UART's transmit and receive pins to the corresponding pins on the target device.
3. Configure the UART's baud rate and other parameters as needed.

## Verification

To verify the functionality of the UART IP block, you can use a testbench and simulation tool to perform various test scenarios, including data transmission and reception at different baud rates, error handling, and boundary cases.
