Project Title: PCIe Endpoint Controller

Description:
Design a PCIe Endpoint Controller that functions as an endpoint device in a PCIe communication link. The PCIe Endpoint Controller will be responsible for handling PCIe transactions, managing data transfers between the host and the endpoint, and responding to configuration requests from the host.

Specifications:

PCIe Protocol:
Implement PCIe 3.0 or PCIe 4.0 protocol for communication between the PCIe Endpoint Controller and the PCIe Root Complex (host).

Configuration Space:
Support PCIe Configuration Space and provide registers for configuration and control. Allow the host to read and write configuration registers to configure the endpoint.

Data Transfer:
Implement data transfer mechanisms such as Memory Read, Memory Write, and I/O Read/Write for efficient data exchange between the host and the endpoint.

Completion Handling:
Handle completion packets for PCIe transactions initiated by the host. Process completions for Read and Write transactions accordingly.

Error Handling:
Implement error handling mechanisms to manage errors such as Data Link Layer (DLL) errors and Transaction Layer Packet (TLP) errors.

Interrupt Handling:
Support PCIe interrupts and provide a mechanism for the host to raise interrupts at the endpoint. Implement interrupt moderation if applicable.

Power Management:
Include support for PCIe power management features such as L0, L1, L2, and L3 power states.

Clock and Reset Management:
Implement proper clock and reset handling to ensure reliable and stable operation of the PCIe Endpoint Controller.

Physical Layer (Optional):
If desired, add support for the Physical Layer (PHY) to enable physical PCIe link establishment and communication.

Verification:
Design comprehensive testbenches to verify the functionality and compliance of the PCIe Endpoint Controller with the PCIe specification.

Remember to thoroughly study the PCIe specification and guidelines while working on this project. The PCIe standard is complex and has specific requirements that need to be followed for successful integration with PCIe-based systems.

Building a PCIe Endpoint Controller will provide you with a hands-on understanding of the PCIe protocol and how PCIe devices interact with the host. Additionally, it will enhance your SystemVerilog skills and knowledge of hardware design and verification. Happy learning and coding!
