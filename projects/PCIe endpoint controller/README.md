# Project Title: PCIe Endpoint Controller

## Project Description:
Design a PCIe Endpoint Controller that functions as an endpoint device in a PCIe communication link. The PCIe Endpoint Controller will be responsible for handling PCIe transactions, managing data transfers between the host and the endpoint, and responding to configuration requests from the host.

## Module Specifications:

### PCIe Endpoint Controller Module:

#### Parts:
- PCIe Protocol: Implement PCIe 3.0 or PCIe 4.0 protocol for communication between the PCIe Endpoint Controller and the PCIe Root Complex (host).
- Configuration Space: Support PCIe Configuration Space and provide registers for configuration and control. Allow the host to read and write configuration registers to configure the endpoint.
- Data Transfer: Implement data transfer mechanisms such as Memory Read, Memory Write, and I/O Read/Write for efficient data exchange between the host and the endpoint.
- Completion Handling: Handle completion packets for PCIe transactions initiated by the host. Process completions for Read and Write transactions accordingly.
- Error Handling: Implement error handling mechanisms to manage errors such as Data Link Layer (DLL) errors and Transaction Layer Packet (TLP) errors.
- Interrupt Handling: Support PCIe interrupts and provide a mechanism for the host to raise interrupts at the endpoint. Implement interrupt moderation if applicable.
- Power Management: Include support for PCIe power management features such as L0, L1, L2, and L3 power states.
- Clock and Reset Management: Implement proper clock and reset handling to ensure reliable and stable operation of the PCIe Endpoint Controller.
- Physical Layer (Optional): If desired, add support for the Physical Layer (PHY) to enable physical PCIe link establishment and communication.

### Verification:
Design comprehensive testbenches to verify the functionality and compliance of the PCIe Endpoint Controller with the PCIe specification.

## Explanation of PCIe Endpoint Controller Logic:

- The PCIe Endpoint Controller is responsible for handling PCIe transactions with the host (PCIe Root Complex).
- It operates according to the PCIe 3.0 or PCIe 4.0 protocol, which defines the rules for data exchange and configuration between PCIe devices.
- The endpoint controller includes support for PCIe Configuration Space, where configuration and control registers are located. These registers can be accessed by the host to configure the endpoint device.
- The controller implements data transfer mechanisms like Memory Read, Memory Write, and I/O Read/Write to facilitate data exchange between the host and the endpoint.
- When the host initiates a transaction, the endpoint controller manages the transaction and responds to it as required. For Read transactions, it processes completion packets containing the requested data. For Write transactions, it ensures that data is correctly stored at the target address.
- The endpoint controller handles error conditions such as DLL errors and TLP errors to maintain the integrity of data transmission.
- It supports PCIe interrupts and can moderate interrupts if required by the application.
- Power management features like L0, L1, L2, and L3 power states are included to manage power consumption based on the device's activity.
- Proper clock and reset management ensures stable operation and reliable communication between the endpoint and the host.

## Testbench Module:

Design comprehensive testbenches to thoroughly verify the functionality and compliance of the PCIe Endpoint Controller with the PCIe specification.
Generate test stimuli to emulate PCIe transactions and verify the correctness of the responses from the endpoint controller.
Include scenarios to test error handling, interrupt handling, and power management features of the endpoint controller.

Remember to refer to the PCIe specification and guidelines while working on this project. PCIe is a complex standard with specific requirements that must be followed for successful integration with PCIe-based systems.

## Brief explanation of PCIE protocol:

The PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express) is a high-speed, high-performance serial bus standard used for connecting various peripheral devices to a computer's motherboard. It serves as a replacement for older parallel bus standards like PCI and PCI-X, providing faster data transfer rates and improved scalability. To explain how PCIe works using the Pareto method, we will cover the following aspects:

Overview of PCIe (80% of explanation):

PCIe is a point-to-point serial bus architecture, meaning each device is connected directly to the host (root complex) through its own dedicated link.
It uses differential signaling to transmit data, which reduces noise and improves reliability.
PCIe supports multiple lanes, where each lane carries data independently, enabling higher bandwidth by adding more lanes.
The key elements of PCIe are endpoints (devices), switches, and the root complex (host).
Data Transfer Mechanism (15% of explanation):

PCIe uses packets to transfer data. A transaction starts with a TLP (Transaction Layer Packet) containing the data payload, address, and control information.
TLPs are forwarded from one device to another through switches until they reach the destination endpoint.
The endpoint processes the TLP and sends back a completion packet to acknowledge the transaction.
Link Configuration and Negotiation (5% of explanation):

During link training and initialization, devices negotiate the number of lanes and link speed to establish a stable connection.
Devices use the link training process to determine the best possible link configuration, ensuring optimal data transfer.
In summary, PCIe is a high-speed serial bus standard that provides a scalable and efficient method for connecting peripheral devices to a computer's motherboard. It uses differential signaling and point-to-point links to achieve fast data transfer rates. PCIe transactions are packet-based, and devices negotiate link configurations to ensure reliable data transfer.
