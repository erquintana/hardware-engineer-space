## Description

The PCIe Endpoint Controller is a hardware design that functions as an endpoint device in a PCIe communication link. It is responsible for handling PCIe transactions, managing data transfers between the host and the endpoint, and responding to configuration requests from the host.

## Specifications

1. **PCIe Protocol:** The design implements PCIe 3.0 or PCIe 4.0 protocol for communication between the PCIe Endpoint Controller and the PCIe Root Complex (host).

2. **Configuration Space:** The design supports PCIe Configuration Space and provides registers for configuration and control. The host can read and write configuration registers to configure the endpoint.

3. **Data Transfer:** The design implements data transfer mechanisms such as Memory Read, Memory Write, and I/O Read/Write for efficient data exchange between the host and the endpoint.

4. **Completion Handling:** The design handles completion packets for PCIe transactions initiated by the host. It processes completions for Read and Write transactions accordingly.

5. **Error Handling:** The design implements error handling mechanisms to manage errors such as Data Link Layer (DLL) errors and Transaction Layer Packet (TLP) errors.

6. **Interrupt Handling:** The design supports PCIe interrupts and provides a mechanism for the host to raise interrupts at the endpoint. It implements interrupt moderation if applicable.

7. **Power Management:** The design includes support for PCIe power management features such as L0, L1, L2, and L3 power states.

8. **Clock and Reset Management:** The design implements proper clock and reset handling to ensure reliable and stable operation of the PCIe Endpoint Controller.

9. **Physical Layer (Optional):** If desired, the design can include support for the Physical Layer (PHY) to enable physical PCIe link establishment and communication.

10. **Verification:** The design is accompanied by comprehensive testbenches to verify its functionality and compliance with the PCIe specification.

## Getting Started

To get started with the PCIe Endpoint Controller project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Review the design files in the project directory, including RTL code and testbenches.
3. Use a suitable simulation tool (e.g., ModelSim, VCS) to run the testbenches and verify the design functionality.
4. Make any necessary modifications or enhancements to meet your specific requirements.
5. Refer to the PCIe specification and guidelines for a deeper understanding of the PCIe protocol.
