# UVM Register Model Framework (URF)

![UVM Logo](https://www.accellera.org/images/downloads/logo-uvm.png)

## Description

The UVM Register Model Framework (URF) is a library that provides a reusable and configurable register model for UVM-based verification environments. It simplifies the creation and management of register models, allowing users to focus on higher-level verification tasks.

## Key Features

- **Register Abstraction:** URF provides an abstract representation of registers, fields, and register blocks. It allows easy modeling of the memory map and register configurations of the DUT (Design Under Test).

- **Configurability:** URF is highly configurable, allowing users to customize register models based on the DUT's register specification.

- **Register Access:** URF supports different access mechanisms, including direct register access, front-door access, and back-door access.

- **Register Callbacks:** URF allows users to define callbacks for register read and write operations, enabling users to add custom behavior during register access.

- **Register Coverage:** URF provides built-in support for functional and code coverage of register accesses.

- **Verification Sequences:** URF includes a set of pre-defined sequences for register verification, accelerating test development.

## Getting Started

To get started with the UVM Register Model Framework (URF) project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Review the URF library files and example testbenches in the project directory.
3. Use a UVM-compliant simulation tool (e.g., Questa, VCS) to run the provided testbenches and verify the register models.
4. Customize the register models and testbenches to fit your specific DUT register specification.
5. Refer to the UVM User Guide for more information on using UVM in your verification environment.
